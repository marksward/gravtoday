A few conversations recently have tripped up with some confusion that Mindfulness and Meditation are the same thing. I'll try and lay out the differences here.

### Mindfulness
Mindfulness as desribed previously can be described as a state of being non-judgementally aware of the present moment. Being Mindful helps ensure our actions and habits are what we intend to do rather than what we do automatically or emotionally. We may habitually respond to situations without any awareness, potentially causing us regret. Awareness allows us to focus fully on what we are interacting with and respond with greater knowledge and understanding.

### Meditatation
Meditation is one of the tools that can help us become more Mindful. It could be likened to a swimmer doing daily press-ups, its not swimming but the practice will improve thier swimming. 

Meditation can be both formal and informal. Formal Meditation is when we usually sit for a period of time. Information Meditation is taking a moments opportunity to be Meditate to bring yourself to a more Mndful state. If you're about to head into a meeting that you feel is going to be tough a quick informal Meditation of taking a slow breath and becoming aware of how you feel and what thoughts are in your mind.

Regular formal Meditation lays the foundations to becoming more Mindfully aware. Its best to formally Meditate daily. Quality regular formal Meditation is more effective than sparodically meditating or Meditating for too long without any quality.
