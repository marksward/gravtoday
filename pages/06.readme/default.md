## What is this place?
Heres lies a collection of (mostly) technology articles and resources. Thoughts, opinions and bookmarked awesomeness in the world of technology and Digital Experience. We'll also dip into some lifestyle/biohacking info to round things up a little.

The site itself is built on [GRAV CMS](https://getgrav.org/) a phenominal flat file based CMS for those site that don't need the grunt and complexity of a database driven CMS. GRAV is lean mean and incredibly easy to use whilst offering TWIG templating and MarkDown editing.

Each edit to the site is synced to a public GitHub repository using GRAVs gitSync plugin.
